If you want to love me better, then you'll have to start again
And if you want me to believe you, then you'll try try again
Cos you can't bring me to water and expect me not to drink
You can't blow out the candle and expect me not to blink
You took me to the mountain top, but I've seen all I want to see
You took me to paradise, but I feel you're lost to me
You took me to hell and back, but it's just not cool with me
If you want me to forgive you then you'll never do it again
And I'll tell you when you're worth it, but you won't mean nothing till then
You took me to the mountain top, but I've seen all I want to see
You took me to paradise, but I feel you're lost to me
You took me to hell and back, but it's just not cool with me
