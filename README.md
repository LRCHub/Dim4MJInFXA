# Joji – Love Me Better

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Build me with your mind, your design
Pray that everything aligns, I won't shy away
All we have is time, and you
Made it look so easy
Can you let me shine? Let me shine
When you said that you were mine
All that energy, left it all behind, and I
Still don't believe it
Ooh, I would have stayed forever
Ooh, if you loved me better
Hold me down
Take me higher
Grains of sand
In a sea of stars
(Ooh) Nothing else matters
Just love me better
(Ooh) Just love me better
```
